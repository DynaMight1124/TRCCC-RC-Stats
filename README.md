# 🏎️ RC-Results Club Stats & Analytics Hub

A modern, dark-mode motorsport dashboard for Radio Controlled (RC) car racing clubs. Automatically scrapes race results from [rc-results.com](https://www.rc-results.com), calculates deep driver and club analytics, and serves a static dashboard hosted for free on **GitHub Pages**.

Initially configured for **Mid Devon RC Raceway (`venueId=1119`)**, and built from the ground up to be **100% portable to any RC club** using RC-Timing and `rc-results.com`.

## 🤖 Automated Updates via GitHub Actions

The repository includes a ready-to-run GitHub Actions workflow in [`.github/workflows/update-stats.yml`](.github/workflows/update-stats.yml):

* **Automated Weekly Schedule**: Runs automatically every Sunday evening (20:00 UTC) and Monday morning (06:00 UTC) following weekend race meetings.
* **Incremental Scrape**: Checks Page 1 of `VenueMeetings`. If all meetings are already archived, it exits within 2 seconds. If new meetings exist, it scrapes only the new meetings, updates the statistics, commits the changes to Git, and deploys directly to GitHub Pages.
* **Manual Trigger**: You can trigger an immediate update at any time by navigating to **Actions** → **Update RC Stats & Deploy to GitHub Pages** → **Run workflow** in GitHub.

## 🛠️ How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   * Create a new repository on GitHub (e.g. `rc-stats`).

   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial release of RC-Results stats hub"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   * Go to **Settings** → **Pages** in your GitHub repository.
   * Under **Build and deployment** → **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
   * Run the workflow once (or wait for the scheduled run). Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`!

## 🔄 Using This for Another Club (Multi-Club Portability)

Any RC racing club using `rc-results.com` can adopt this dashboard in less than 5 minutes:

1. **Find Your Club's Venue ID**:
   * Visit [rc-results.com](https://www.rc-results.com) and click on your club.
   * Look at the URL in your browser address bar:
     `https://www.rc-results.com/Viewer/Main/VenueMeetings?venueId=XXXX`
   * Copy the number `XXXX` (e.g. `14` for Adur, `19` for Aldershot, `1119` for Mid Devon).
2. **Update `club_config.json`**:
   ```json
   {
     "venueId": XXXX,
     "clubName": "Your Club Name Here",
     "shortName": "YCN",
     "tagline": "Indoor & Outdoor RC Racing Club",
     "website": "https://www.rc-results.com/Viewer/Main/VenueMeetings?venueId=XXXX",
     "trackType": "Off-Road Carpet / Astro",
     "location": "Your Town, Country",
     "primaryColor": "#e11d48",
     "secondaryColor": "#0ea5e9"
   }
   ```
3. **Run a Full Initial Scrape**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python scraper/scraper.py --full
   python scraper/aggregator.py
   ```
   > [!TIP]
   > **Automatic Clean & Club Isolation**: When you change `venueId` in `club_config.json`, `scraper.py` automatically detects the venue switch and purges all previous club data from `raw_data/` and `docs/data/drivers/`. You can also pass `--clean` (`python scraper/scraper.py --full --clean`) at any time to force a clean slate. Data from different clubs will never be merged.

4. Commit and push your changes to GitHub. Your club's analytics dashboard is now live and will stay updated automatically!
